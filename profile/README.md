## ✒️ Project Title :
ATongs: Integrated App for classification and news about Waste

## 📄 Descriptions :

Based on the UN Environmental Programme website, Indonesia is the fourth-most populous country and the second-largest plastic polluter after China. The country produces 3.2 million metric tons of unmanaged plastic waste annually, of which about 1.29 million are in the sea. How can Indonesia enhance its waste collection and recycling infrastructure to tackle plastic pollution? Our project aims to encourage users to recycle waste by identifying recyclable materials and providing recommendations on how to recycle them. By encouraging ATongs users to recycle, we aim to reduce approximately 10% of recyclable waste in landfills.

We observed that the garbage around our living environment is still worth recycling, but most people immediately throw the trash away without thinking about recycling. Our goal in this project is to educate people to prioritize recycling wastes such as plastic waste, learn how to recycle waste and see the bright side of their waste.

ATongs team will develop an android application that can classify a trash that is able to be recycled, the program then will recommend the user of the methods on how to recycle the trash or show the user the nearest waste bank in their location. The program will give points for each successful recycled or donated trash.
